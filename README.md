# Youtube_Clone_React
Here, I'm using React and RapidAPI to create a YouTube clone with a lot of features. These features include searching for videos, playing them, filtering videos by type, and displaying channels and their videos. All of this is done using real data from RapidAPI. I'm using technologies such as React, React Router, RapidAPI, various hooks (including custom hooks), and Tailwind for styling.
